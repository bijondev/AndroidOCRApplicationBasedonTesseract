AndroidOCR Application Basedon Tesseract


Optical character recognition (OCR) is the process of extracting text from images or scanned documents. Tesseract is an open-source OCR engine that can be used to build OCR applications for various platforms, including Android. Here is an example of how to use Tesseract in an Android app to perform OCR on an image:

    Add the Tesseract library to your app's build.gradle file:
```
implementation 'com.rmtheis:tess-two:9.0.0'
```
    Initialize Tesseract and set the language:
```
TessBaseAPI tessBaseAPI = new TessBaseAPI();
tessBaseAPI.init(TESSDATA_PATH, "eng");
```
    Load the image into Tesseract:
```
Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(imagePath);
tessBaseAPI.setImage(bitmap);
```
    Extract the text from the image:
```
String text = tessBaseAPI.getUTF8Text();
```
    Close Tesseract:
```
tessBaseAPI.end();
```
That's it! You can now use the extracted text in your app.

I hope this helps give you an idea of how to use Tesseract in an Android app to perform OCR. Let me know if you have any questions.
